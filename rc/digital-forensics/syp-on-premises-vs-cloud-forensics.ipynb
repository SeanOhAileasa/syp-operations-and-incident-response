The regulations regarding the use and access to data in one location may be very different than the rules in another location. \n",

In that particular case, the physical location of the data center may determine the legal jurisdiction for that data. From a forensics perspective, this could work against you when you’re trying to perform any type of analysis, for example, some countries don’t allow any type of electronic searches if the search is coming from outside of their country, so it may be very important to include your legal team as you’re stepping through the process of digital forensics in these cloud-based locations."
